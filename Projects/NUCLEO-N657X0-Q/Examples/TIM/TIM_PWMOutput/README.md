## <b>TIM_PWMOutput Example Description</b>

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.

The system clock runs at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed.

    In this example TIM1 input clock (TIM1CLK) is set to TIMPRE clock,
    since TIMPRE prescaler is equal to 1.
      TIMPRE = SYSB
      => TIM1CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock

    To get TIM1 counter clock at 1 MHz, the prescaler is computed as follows:
       Prescaler = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1
       Prescaler = ((SystemCoreClock/2) /1 MHz) - 1

    To get TIM1 output clock at 25 KHz, the period (ARR)) is computed as follows:
       ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / TIM1 output clock) - 1
           = 39

    TIM1 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR1/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 50%
    TIM1 Channel2 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR2/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 37.5%
    TIM1 Channel3 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR3/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 25%
    TIM1 Channel4 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR4/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 12.5%

LED2 is ON when there are an error.

The PWM waveforms can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. The duty cycles values mentioned above are theoretical (obtained when the system clock frequency is exactly 600 MHz).
    They might be slightly different depending on system clock frequency precision.

 2. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 3. This example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657X0HxQ devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 600 MHz.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-N657X0-Q 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-N657X0-Q Set-up
   Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:

       - TIM1_CH1 : PE.09 (pin 31 in CN15 connector)
       - TIM1_CH2 : PE.11 (pin 23 in CN15 connector)
       - TIM1_CH3 : PE.13 (pin 28 in CN15 connector)
       - TIM1_CH4 : PE.14 (pin 26 in CN15 connector)


  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out.

  - **MDK-ARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must comment out SCB_EnableDCache() in main() function.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 2-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:
 
 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in the board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.
 

**Warning** If using CubeProgrammer v2.21 version or more recent, add *-align* option in the command line.
