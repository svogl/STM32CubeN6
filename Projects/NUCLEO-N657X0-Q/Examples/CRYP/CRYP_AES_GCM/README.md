## <b>CRYP_AES_GCM Example Description</b>

How to use the CRYPTO peripheral to encrypt and decrypt data using AES with
Galois/Counter mode (GCM).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.

The system clock runs at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed.

The AES-GCM mode requires:

1. Plain text which will be authenticated and encrypted. Its size must be a
   multiple of 16 bytes. So if the original plain text size is not a multiple
   of 16 bytes, it must be padded.
   
2. Header that will be authenticated but not encrypted. The header size must be
   multiple of 16 bytes whatever the key size.
   
3. Initialization vector a value that is used only once within a specified
   context. It must be padded to 16-byte length with LSB set to 2.
   
4. Key is the parameter which determines the cipher text. For this example the
   key size can be 128 bits =16 bytes and can be tailored to 192 bits or 256 bits.
   In this example we are using a 256 bits key.

The AES-GCM provides:

1. Cipher text which is the encryption result of the Plaint text. In this
   example, the cipher text is available in "EncryptedText".
   
   Its size is the same as the plain text.
   
2. Plain text which is the decryption result of the Cipher text. In this
   example, the plain text is available in "DecryptedText".
   
   Its size is the same as the plain text.
   
3. TAG: The Message Authentication Code which is used for both message
   authentication and message tampering detection. It's size is always 16 bytes.

The blue LED (LED1) is turned ON, in case the encryption/decryption and tag are
computed correctly, in case there is a mismatch the red LED is turned ON (LED2).

#### <b>Notes</b>

   1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

   2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657X0HxQ devices.

  - This template has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-N657X0-Q
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out. 

  - **MDK-ARM** : it is not possible to monitor a variable in the live watch window    

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 2-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:
 
 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in the board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.


**Warning** If using CubeProgrammer v2.21 version or more recent, add *-align* option in the command line.
