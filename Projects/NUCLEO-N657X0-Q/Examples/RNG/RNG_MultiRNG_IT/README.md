## <b>RNG_MultiRNG_IT Example Description</b>

How to generate random numbers under interrupt with the RNG HAL API. 

This example uses RNG interrupts to generate 32-bit long random numbers.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.

The system clock runs at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed.

The RNG peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RNG_Init() function.

The latter is calling the HAL_RNG_MspInit() function which implements
the configuration of the needed RNG resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change RNG configuration.

After startup, user is asked to press USER push-button.

The 8-entry array aRandom32bit[] is filled up by 32-bit long random numbers 
at each USER push-button press.

Each random number generation triggers an interruption which is handled by 
HAL_RNG_ReadyDataCallback() API to retrieve and store the random number.
 
The random numbers can be displayed on the debugger in aRandom32bit variable.

In case of error, LED2 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657X0HxQ devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out.

  - **MDK-ARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must comment out SCB_EnableDCache() in main() function.

### <b>How to use it ?</b> 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 2-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:
 
 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in the board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.
 


**Warning** If using CubeProgrammer v2.21 version or more recent, add *-align* option in the command line.
