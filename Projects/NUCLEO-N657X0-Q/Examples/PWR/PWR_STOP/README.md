## <b>PWR_STOP Example Description</b>

How to enter the Stop mode and wake-up from this mode by using an interrupt.

The system clock runs at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed.

In the associated software, an EXTI line is connected to the user button through PC13 and configured to generate an
interrupt on falling edge upon key press.

The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick 
interrupt handler, LED1 is toggled in order to indicate whether the MCU is in stop mode 
or run mode.

Two leds LED1 and LED2 are used to monitor the system state as following:

 - LED2 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED1 toggling: system in Run mode
 - LED1 off : system in Stop mode

5 seconds after start-up, the system automatically enters stop mode and LED1 stops toggling.

The USER push-button can be pressed at any time to wake-up the system.

The software then comes back in run mode for 5 sec. before automatically entering stop mode again.

*Note:* To measure the current consumption in stop mode,  refer to NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board User Manual.

*Note:* This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact
        that the Cortex-M55 core is no longer clocked during low power mode
        so debugging features are disabled.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657X0HxQ devices

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-N657X0-Q
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-N657X0-Q Set-up
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PG.08 and PG.10 pins

  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out.

  - **MDK-ARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must comment out SCB_EnableDCache() in main() function.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 2-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:
 
 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in the board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.
 

**Warning** If using CubeProgrammer v2.21 version or more recent, add *-align* option in the command line.
