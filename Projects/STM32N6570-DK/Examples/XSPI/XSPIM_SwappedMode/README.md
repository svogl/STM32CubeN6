## <b>XSPIM_SwappedMode Example Description</b>

- This project provides a description of how to configure XSPIM IO Manager peripheral and commuinicate
  with external memories in Swapped mode.
- This project is targeted to run on STM32H7S7xx device on STM326570-DK board from STMicroelectronics.
  At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
  all the peripherals and initialize the systick used as 1ms HAL timebase.
- The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK)to run at 600 MHz.
- The XSPIM_SwappedMode project calls also SCB_EnableICache() and SCB_EnableDCache() functions in order to enable
  the Layer 1 Core Instruction and Data Caches. This is provided as example implementation that the User
  may integrate in his application in order to enhance the performance.

- LED_GREEN LED is ON when the checked data is correct.
- LED_RED is ON as soon as a comparison error occurs.
- LED_RED toggles as soon as an error is returned by HAL API.


#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N6xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32N6570-DK
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - On STM32N6570-DK board, the BOOT0 mechanical slide switch must be set to SW1.


  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out.

  - **MDK-ARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must comment out SCB_EnableDCache() in main() function.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 1-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:
 
 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in the board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.



**Warning** If using CubeProgrammer v2.21 version or more recent, add *-align* option in the command line.
